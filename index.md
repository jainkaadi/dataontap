## What is DataOnTap?
This is my personal analytics repository. Over the years, I have suffered a lot because I learn things and i forget them in a few weeks time.

## What will you find here?
So i have decided to keep it all in one place. On this site, you will find:
- bigquery and python code snippets for common use cases
- DBT implementations
- Tools and their tricks (wherever i have used them)
- Google sheets and how to do things with it
- Google scripts and it's many, many automation use cases
- Links to substacks i follow, articles i have learnt from, youtube videos and playlists
- And analytics tools for every purpose.

This is partially because i have become obsessed with tech after avoiding it for most of my career. I have realized that tech cannot be avoided. So you will find details about a ton of tools. Once i have a larger database, I will extract the data and put it elsewhere for easier use.

## Paywalled Stuff
You will also find: Some paywalled things. Connect with me on linkedin to get access to them.

If you like it, feel free to drop me a message or buy me a coffee. I do love coffee. The link for coffee will come up soon enough.
